We lost points in Stage 1 because we did not specify what CRUD operations our application was going to support and how.

Right after the Functinoality section, we have added a specific CRUD Operations section which explains in depth what all operations we support and how.

We have updated the file "CS 411 Proposal.pdf" in the 'docs' folder itself.
