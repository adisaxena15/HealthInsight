## Project Summary

This project aims to enhance patient care by integrating data visualization and chatbot using two healthcare-related datasets. The first component uses the Healthcare Documentation Database to create an interactive visualization tool that maps common patient symptoms to diagnosis. This tool will help patients and healthcare professionals identify patterns and relationships, providing valuable insights into common symptom-diagnosis connections. We will also use this dataset to create a search engine to allow users to search for all patient records containing information for their related topics. However, it does not provide a conclusive diagnosis, just a correlation of symptoms. 

The second component involves developing an AI-powered chatbot augmented with the Healthcare NLP dataset, which contains symptom-related questions and corresponding answers. This chatbot will assist patients by providing accurate and contextually relevant responses to their health-related queries. By integrating language models, the chatbot will improve engagement and accessibility, ensuring users receive reliable information about their symptoms. Together, these tools will bridge the gap between medical data and patient understanding, making healthcare insights more accessible and actionable.
